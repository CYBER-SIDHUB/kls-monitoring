# kls-monitoring

## Adding monitoring stack for Kafka, Logstash and Splunk

## A python script (kafka_conn.py) which produces json messages, I am capturing them over kafka consumer.

## Using logstash, collecting these messages from kafka and sending them over to splunk.

## Here they can be captured and monitored.

## This is just a sample project for self-learning.
